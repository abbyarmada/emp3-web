        <p>Extensible Map Platform (EMP) is a framework for displaying and manipulating geospatial data with Android and
            Web applications. This development guide provides an overview of the capabilities of EMP and how to use EMP
            within your application</p>
        <h2>EMP3 Web</h2>
        <p>The EMP3 Web capability is based from the first EMP iteration so has a comparable amount of capability as EMP
            with the addition of some new capabilities and refreshed user interface in the works.</p>
        Use Cases:
        <ul>
            <li>Integration into the COE v3 Web Client Plugin Framework</li>
            <li>Integration into web applications as a native component</li>
            <li>Use as a "widget" in Ozone Widget Framework and Ozone Platform</li>
            <li>Use as a "widget" via HTML 5 standards such as HTML Messaging</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>EMP3 Android</h2>
        <p>EMP3 Android is brand new and in an early stage. The goal with the Android version is to implement a
            consistent architecture with the web version, a developer facing API that is consistent in naming, style,
            and capability set. Initially it will support the Android NASA WorldWind SDK.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Integration into the COE v3 Smart Client Plugin Framework</li>
            <li>Integration into Android Applications API 19 (4.4.2) and newer</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Architecture</h2>
        <p>EMP3 is broken into a modular design with 4 primary component areas:</p>
        <img src="img/components.png" style="width: 100%"/>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Map API</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Acts as single, consistent interface for any application that uses the map framework</li>
                    <li>Currently Implements <a href="http://www.cmapi.org" target="_blank">CMAPI 1.3.0</a> and CMAPI
                        geospatial notation for joint interoperability
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Map Core</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Performs majority of map internal business logic</li>
                    <li>Stores data hierarchy and manages instance counts within data hierarchies</li>
                    <li>Interacts with map engine through engine interface</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Map Engine Interface</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Ensures consistent interface between map core and map engine implementation</li>
                    <li>Protects map API and Map Core from different internal interfaces used by map engine SDKs</li>
                    <li>Enables changing of map engine with least possible code overturn</li>
                    <li>Provides coverage of what a map engine implementation glue code must provide</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Map Engine Implementation</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Glue Code
                        <ul>
                            <li>Translates data and events between 3rd party SDK and the normalized map engine interface
                                types
                            </li>
                            <li>Allows for integration of multiple 3rd party map SDKs without affecting development
                                community using the EMP3 API
                            </li>
                            <li>Establish clear contract for integration of new map SDKs as needed</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>3rd Party Map SDK
                        <ul>
                            <li>Provides actual geospatial visualization of map, terrain, and feature data</li>
                            <li>Examples Are Cesium, Leaflet, NASA WorldWind</li>
                            <li>Developer interacting with EMP3 API has no knowledge of the specific SDK and can be
                                confident their code will run consistently regardless
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
