    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>EMP Web is an SDK for integrating geospatial visualization and interaction in web applications. EMP abstracts away vendor specific map tool kits and APIs enabling your application to choose between map engine providers, such as Cesium or Leaflet, while using a simple, consistent API.
</p><p>
EMP provides a streamlined API with many helper utilities making complex interactions, such as drawing and editing Ellipses, Rectangles, and MIL-STD-2525 Tactical graphics a breeze.</p>

        Use Cases:
        <ul>
            <li>Integration into web applications as a native component</li>
            <li>Use as a "widget" via HTML 5 standards such as HTML Messaging for window to iframe, window to window, or tab to tab communication between your web application and an EMP map instance running on a seprate page.</li>
            <li>Use as a "widget" in Ozone Widget Framework and Ozone Platform</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Architecture</h2>
        <p>EMP3 is broken into a modular design with 4 primary component areas:</p>
        <img src="img/components.png" style="width: 100%" />
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Map API</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Acts as single, consistent interface for any application that uses the map framework</li>
                    <li><a href="http://www.cmapi.org" target="_blank">CMAPI 1.3.0</a> compliant - <em>NOTE users of EMP do not need to know about or understand CMAPI</em>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Map Core</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Performs majority of map internal business logic</li>
                    <li>Stores data hierarchy and manages instance counts within data hierarchies</li>
                    <li>Interacts with map engine through engine interface</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Map Engine Interface</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Ensures consistent interface between map core and map engine implementation</li>
                    <li>Protects map API and Map Core from different internal interfaces used by map engine SDKs</li>
                    <li>Enables changing of map engine with least possible code overturn</li>
                    <li>Provides coverage of what a map engine implementation glue code must provide</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Map Engine Implementation</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Glue Code
                        <ul>
                            <li>Translates data and events between 3rd party SDK and the normalized map engine interface types
                            </li>
                            <li>Allows for integration of multiple 3rd party map SDKs without affecting development community using the EMP3 API
                            </li>
                            <li>Establish clear contract for integration of new map SDKs as needed</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>3rd Party Map SDK
                        <ul>
                            <li>Provides actual geospatial visualization of map, terrain, and feature data</li>
                            <li>Examples Are Cesium, Leaflet, NASA World Wind Web</li>
                            <li>Developer interacting with EMP3 API has no knowledge of the specific SDK and can be confident their code will run consistently regardless of the map engine being used
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ol>
